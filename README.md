Technical Description of Autonomous Wick Irrigation Community Garden System:
Composting System
	We will be using vermicomposting systems for our community gardens as they are much more efficient than traditional aerobic composting systems as they take less time, and the worms within the bins can self-multiply within a relatively short time frame if more people use the worm bin.
    
    itself when compared will consist of multiple horizontally oriented worm bins located next to 
  Rudimentary Rain Reservoir System

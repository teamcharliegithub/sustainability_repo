**## Technical Description of Autonomous Wick Irrigation Community Garden System:##**
> Our system has three parts. A composting system, a rainwater reservoir irrigation system, and a plant growth system. Our composting system will take all carbon and nitrogen related inputs from the community in the form of food scraps, lawn clippings, etc. and process it with worms into worm casting and nutrient dense liquid (which is compost and "worm tea"). The compost will then be manualy transfered to the community garden boxes to be used as fertilizer

**##Composting System##**
> We will be using vermicomposting systems for our community gardens as they are much more efficient than traditional aerobic composting systems. They take much less time which is vital for systems that will serve a hundred or more people, and the worms within the bins can self-multiply within a relatively short time frame. This is vital if more people use the worm bins as the community grows, as the worm population will naturally sustain itself and hover around its carrying capacity within the mini ecosystem. It could also help start up more more pop up community gardens in surrounding areas as they would already have a base population of worms to start with, essentially for free.
  itself when compared will consist of multiple horizontally oriented worm bins located next to
